By optimizing ABR-ladders for specific content, you will make sure to not have wasteful rungs and this has been shown to [cut bandwidth usage in half](https://dev.to/video/automating-video-analysis-to-cut-your-streaming-bandwidth-usage-in-half-5hk1).

## Usage

Only possible to run in AWS at the moment. You will need a running ECS cluster with a task definition configured to run [easyvmaf-s3](https://github.com/Eyevinn/easyvmaf_s3).

### Installation

```bash
npm install --save @eyevinn/autovmaf
```

### Run tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Environment Variables

A few environment variables can be set. These are:

```bash
LOAD_CREDENTIALS_FROM_ENV=true   //Load AWS credentials from environment variables
AWS_REGION=eu-north-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ABCD...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=EFGH...
```

### Generate VMAF measurements

To generate VMAF measurements, you will need to define a job which can be created with the `createJob()`-function. 

```typescript
  const { createJob } = require('@eyevinn/autovmaf');
 
  const vmafScores = await = createJob({
    name: "MyVMAFmeasurements",
    pipeline: "pipeline.yml",
    encodingProfile: "profile.json",
    reference: "reference.mp4",
    models: ["HD", "PhoneHD"],                       // optional
    resolutions: [{ width: 1280, height: 720 }],     // optional
    bitrates: [600000],                              // optional
    method: "bruteForce"                             // optional
  });
```

When creating a job, you can specify:

 * **Name**
    -  This will name the folder in which to put the files.
 * **Pipeline**
    * Path to a YAML-file that defines the pipeline. See [`examples/pipeline.yml`](https://github.com/Eyevinn/autovmaf/blob/main/examples/pipeline.yml) for an example AWS-pipeline. _Currently only AWS is supported._
 * **Encoding Profile**
    * Path to a JSON-file that defines how the reference should be encoded. When using AWS, this is a MediaConvert configuration. For local pipelines, this is key-value pairs that will be passed as command line arguments to FFmpeg. See an example for AWS at [`examples/encoding-profile.json`](https://github.com/Eyevinn/autovmaf/blob/main/examples/encoding-profile.json). 
 * **Reference**
    * Path to the reference video to analyze. Normally a local path, but when using AWS, this can also be an S3-URI.
 * **Models** (optional)
    * A list of VMAF-models to use in evaluation. This can be HD, MobileHD and UHD. HD by default.
 * **Resolutions** (optional)
    * A list of resolutions to test. By default it will test all resolutions in the example ABR-ladder provided by Apple in the [HLS Authoring Spec](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/hls_authoring_specification_for_apple_devices).
 * **Bitrates** (optional)
    * A list of bitrates to test. By default a list of bitrates between 150 kbit/s to 9000 kbit/s.
 * **Method** (optional)
    * The method to use when analyzing the videos. Either `bruteForce` or `walkTheHull`. By default `bruteForce`. NOTE: `walkTheHull` is not implemented at the moment.

### Create job using yaml

```typescript
const { createJob } = require('@eyevinn/autovmaf');
const YAML = require('yaml');
const fs = require('fs');
const parseResolutions = resolutions => {
resolutions.map(resolutionStr => ({
   width: parseInt(resolutionStr.split('x')[0]),
   height: parseInt(resolutionStr.split('x')[1]),
  }));
};
const jobFile = fs.readFileSync('job.yml', 'utf-8');
const jobData = YAML.parse(jobFile);
const job = {
  ...jobData,
  resolutions: jobData['resolutions'] !== undefined ?rseResolutions(jobData['resolutions']) : undefined,
};
createJob(job);
```

**An example of creating a job from a YAML-file can be seen in the [`examples-folder`](https://github.com/Eyevinn/autovmaf/tree/main/examples/).**

### Read VMAF-scores

Using `getVmaf()`, you can read VMAF-scores from a JSON-file or a directory of JSON-files. This works on both local paths as well as S3-URIs with a "s3://"-prefix.

Example:

```javascript
const vmafFiles = await getVmaf('s3://path/to/vmaf/');

vmafFiles.forEach(file => {
  console.log(file.filename + ': ' + file.vmaf);
});
```
