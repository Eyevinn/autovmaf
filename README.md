By optimizing ABR-ladders for specific content, you will make sure to not have wasteful rungs and this has been shown to [cut bandwidth usage in half](https://dev.to/video/automating-video-analysis-to-cut-your-streaming-bandwidth-usage-in-half-5hk1).

## Usage

Transcoding and VMAF analysis can either be run in AWS or locally. When running in aws, you will need a running ECS cluster with a task definition configured to run [easyvmaf-s3](https://github.com/Eyevinn/easyvmaf_s3).

### Installation

```bash
npm install --save @eyevinn/autovmaf
```

### Environment Variables

A few environment variables can be set. These are:

```bash
LOAD_CREDENTIALS_FROM_ENV=true   //Load AWS credentials from environment variables
AWS_REGION=eu-north-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ABCD...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=EFGH...
```

### Generate VMAF measurements

To generate VMAF measurements, you will need to define a job which can be created with the `createJob()`-function.

```typescript
const { createJob } = require('@eyevinn/autovmaf');

const vmafScores = await createJob({
  name: 'MyVMAFmeasurements',
  pipeline: 'pipeline.yml',
  encodingProfile: 'profile.json',
  reference: 'reference.mp4',
  models: ['HD', 'PhoneHD'], // optional
  resolutions: [
    {
      // optional
      width: 1280,
      height: 720,
      range: {
        // optional
        min: 500000,
        max: 600000
      }
    }
  ],
  bitrates: [
    // optional
    500000, 600000, 800000
  ],
  method: 'bruteForce' // optional
});
```

When creating a job, you can specify:

- **Name**
  - This will name the folder in which to put the files.
- **Pipeline**
  - Path to a YAML-file that defines the pipeline. See [`examples/pipeline.yml`](https://github.com/Eyevinn/autovmaf/blob/main/examples/aws/pipeline.yml) for an example AWS-pipeline.
  - When running locally, pipeline data can be inlined in the job definition.
- **Encoding Profile**
  - Path to a JSON-file that defines how the reference should be encoded. When using AWS, this is a MediaConvert configuration. See an example for AWS at [`examples/aws/encoding-profile.json`](https://github.com/Eyevinn/autovmaf/blob/main/examples/encoding-profile.json).
    For local pipelines, this is key-value pairs that will be passed as command line arguments to FFmpeg. If pipeline
    data is inlined in the job definition, encodingProfile can be omitted and key-value pairs can instead be set
    in the `ffmpegOptions` property of the pipeline object.
- **Reference**
  - Path to the reference video to analyze. Normally a local path, but when using AWS, this can also be an S3-URI.
- **Models** (optional)
  - A list of VMAF-models to use in evaluation. This can be HD, MobileHD and UHD. HD by default.
- **Resolutions** (optional)
  - A list of resolutions to test. By default it will test all resolutions in the example ABR-ladder provided by Apple in the [HLS Authoring Spec](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/hls_authoring_specification_for_apple_devices).
  - **Range** (optional)
    - A min and max bitrate for testing a specific resolution. Adding a range will filter out bitrates that are outside of the given range. It is disabled by default.
- **Bitrates** (optional)
  - A list of bitrates to test. By default a list of bitrates between 150 kbit/s to 9000 kbit/s.
- **Method** (optional)
  - The method to use when analyzing the videos. Either `bruteForce` or `walkTheHull`. By default `bruteForce`. NOTE: `walkTheHull` is not implemented at the moment.

### Create job using yaml

```typescript
const { createJob } = require('@eyevinn/autovmaf');
const YAML = require('yaml');
const fs = require('fs');
const parseResolutions = (resolutions) => {
  resolutions.map((resolutionStr) => ({
    width: parseInt(resolutionStr.split('x')[0]),
    height: parseInt(resolutionStr.split('x')[1])
  }));
};
const jobFile = fs.readFileSync('job.yml', 'utf-8');
const jobData = YAML.parse(jobFile);
const job = {
  ...jobData,
  resolutions:
    jobData['resolutions'] !== undefined
      ? parseResolutions(jobData['resolutions'])
      : undefined
};
createJob(job);
```

**An example of creating a job from a YAML-file can be seen in the [`examples-folder`](https://github.com/Eyevinn/autovmaf/tree/main/examples/).**

### Read VMAF-scores

Using `getVmaf()`, you can read VMAF-scores from a JSON-file or a directory of JSON-files. This works on both local paths as well as S3-URIs with a "s3://"-prefix.

Example:

```javascript
const vmafFiles = await getVmaf('s3://path/to/vmaf/');

vmafFiles.forEach((file) => {
  console.log(file.filename + ': ' + file.vmaf);
});
```

## CLI Usage

When running with the cli, all transcoding and vmaf analysis will be run locally.

### Requirements

- [easyVmaf](https://github.com/gdavila/easyVmaf)
- [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) >= 5.0, compiled with libvmaf
- [Python](https://www.python.org) >= 3.0

### Global installation

Installing globally with `npm -g` will make the `autovmaf` command available in your path

```bash
npm install -g @eyevinn/autovmaf
```

### Environments variables

- `EASYVMAF_PATH` - needs to point to the file `easyVmaf.py` from your
  easyVmaf installation.
- `FFMPEG_PATH` - only needs to be set if ffmpeg is not in your path.
- `PYTHON_PATH` - only needs to be set if python is not in yur path.

### Command line options

Available command line options for the cli can be listed with the `--help` argument

```bash
autovmaf [source]

run transcode and vmaf analysis for videofile source

Commands:
  autovmaf [source]                 run transcode and vmaf analysis for

                                                      [boolean] [default: false]
  --skipExisting    Skip transcode for allready transcoded files
                                                       [boolean] [default: true]
  --probeBitrate    Read bitrate of transcoded file with ffprobe
                                                      [boolean] [default: false]
  --ffmpeg-options  List of options to pass to ffmpeg, on the form
                    key1=value1:key2=value2                             [string]
```

Output files will be stored in a folder corresponding to the argument given to the `--name` option.
If resolutions and/or bitrates are not specified default values will be used, [See above](#generate-vmaf-measurements).

### Providing job definition in a json or yaml file

With the `--job` option, a path to a yaml or json file with a job definition can be passed to to the cli. The values
defined in the file can be overriden with other commandline options. For instance the `reference` video defined
in the job file can be overridden by passing a source file on the command line.

#### Using variables in the job definition

It is possible to iterate over other variables than bitrate and resolutions when running a local encode. For
instance, to run transcode and vmaf analysis with x265 in CRF mode for a number of CRF values, a job definition
like below can be used (also available in [examples/local/local-job-crf.yaml](examples/local/local-job-crf.yaml))

```yaml
models:
  - HD
resolutions:
  - width: 1920
    height: 1080
bitrates:
  - 0
pipeline:
  ffmpegEncoder: libx265
  singlePass: true
  skipDefaultOptions: true
  ffmpegOptions:
    '-pix_fmt': 'yuv420p'
    '-preset': 'veryslow'
    '-x265-params': 'crf=%CRF%:scenecut=0:keyint=50:min-keyint=50:open-gop=0'
  easyVmafExtraArgs:
    '-threads': 20
pipelineVariables:
  CRF:
    - 22
    - 26
    - 30
    - 34
```

This will run transcode and vmaf analysis for CRF values 22,26,30, and 34. Variables are used in the ffmpeg options
by insterting `%VARIABLENAME%`. This string will then be subtituted with a value from the list of values from
`pipelineVariables.VARIABLENAME`. Note that when running CRF encode or other non-ABR mode, `skipDefaultOptions` must
be set to avoid injecting bitrate options to ffmpeg. Also note that the cli needs to be run with the `--probe-bitrate`
option to get the correct bitrate from the transcoded files.

### Generate VMAF measurements example

```bash
autovmaf --resolutions 1920x1080,1280x720,960x540 --bitrates 500k,800k,1200k,1600k,2000k,3000k,4000k --name my-autovmaf-test1 my-source-video.mp4
```

With the above command, when the run is finished transcoded files will be available in the folder `my-autovmaf-test1`, and vmaf-data in the folder `my-autovmaf-test1/HD`.

## Development

### Run tests

```bash
npm test
```
